# Cran

## Overview

Cran is a Rust library for checking the validity of random data. There are two main methods of use: 1. You can input the
data and let the library run tests automatically, 2. You can run tests yourself on the data. If you only need either a
certain level of certainty, or a only would like to run one of the higher level tests and not any of the lower ones you
could save much time.

## Usage

This will be done when it is actually released.
